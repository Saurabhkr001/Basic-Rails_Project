# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
AdminUser.create!(email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password') if Rails.env.development?
# Create standard users
10.times do |i|
  User.create!(
    name: "Library Member #{i + 1}",
    email: "member#{i + 1}@library.com",
    password: "password123",
    password_confirmation: "password123",
    role: "member"
  )
end

# Create one Librarian
User.create!(
  name: "Main Librarian",
  email: "librarian@library.com",
  password: "libpass",
